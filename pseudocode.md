# pseudocode for Mind Reader App
## Main Goal:
Create single page web app that plays a game. Focus is to Use state management to progress forward to the next view, backward to the previous view, and reset to the first view on the page.
By Default the app should prompt the user to click through the single page app tand see a new view for every step.

- [] Pseudocode the problem in its entirety
- [] Use Javascript to successfully show the transition from one view to the next
- [] Show state management for each step of the single page app("view" 1,2,3,..)
    * Only create a single index.html
    * No need to refresh the page (manually or using JS)
    * Update state using a variable that tells the computer what 'view' it is
    * Use functions to move forward a view, backward, reset to the first view, and display the correct view on load/after every state change
- [] Use Icons of your choice
- [] All multiples of 9 should be the same symbol so the math gimmick works
